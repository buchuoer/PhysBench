Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
You have video processor config saved in `preprocessor.json` file which is deprecated. Video processor configs should be saved in their own `video_preprocessor.json` file. You can rename the file or load and save the processor back which renames it automatically. Loading from `preprocessor.json` will be removed in v5.0.

 Why do eggs explode in the video?
A. Microwave heating causes the air pressure inside the egg to rise rapidly, exceeding the pressure that the eggshell can withstand, causing it to explode.
B. Microwave heating causes the water inside the egg to evaporate rapidly, producing a large amount of steam, which causes the eggshell to crack and explode.
C. Microwave heating causes the temperature inside the egg to rise rapidly, causing the yolk and egg white to expand, squeezing the eggshell and causing it to explode.
D. Microwave heating causes a chemical reaction inside the egg, producing a large amount of gas, which causes the eggshell to crack and explode.
