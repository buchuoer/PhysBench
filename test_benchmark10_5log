Using a slow image processor as `use_fast` is unset and a slow processor was saved with this model. `use_fast=True` will be the default behavior in v4.52, even if the model was saved with a slow processor. This will result in minor differences in outputs. You'll still be able to use a slow processor with `use_fast=False`.
You have video processor config saved in `preprocessor.json` file which is deprecated. Video processor configs should be saved in their own `video_preprocessor.json` file. You can rename the file or load and save the processor back which renames it automatically. Loading from `preprocessor.json` will be removed in v5.0.
